        <h1>Origami</h1>
        <p>Origami is the traditional Japanease art of paper folding.</p>
        <h2>Beginnings</h2>
        <p>While technically originating in 6th century China, Origami was widely popularized in Japan. It became widespread due to 
            the reduced price of washi paper in the Edo period, from 1603 to 1868. </p>
            <p>since then, the art has been practiced throughout the globe, and folders everywhere have
            pushed it to it's limits, whether it be fully fledged <strong>life sized</strong> dragons, to people, to geometrically shaped works of art. </p>
